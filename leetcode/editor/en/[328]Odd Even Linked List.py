# Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices 
# together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list. 
# 
# 
#  The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on. 
# 
#  Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should 
# remain as it was in the input. 
# 
#  You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time 
# complexity. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
# Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Å∂ <= Node.val <= 10‚Å∂
